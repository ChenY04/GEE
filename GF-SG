/**************Information Description*****************/
//the GEE JavaScript code for Gap Filling and Savitzky–Golay filtering method (GF-SG) 
//GF_SG is used for reconstructing high-quality Landsat-like VI time series data of 8-day intervals.
//GF-SG first fills missing values in the original Landsat NDVI time-series data by integrating the MODIS NDVI time-series data and cloud-free Landsat observations.
//A temporal filter is used to remove the residual noise in the synthesized time series.
//GF-SG and filter parameters were initially designed for reconstructing NDVI time series. other vegetation indexes (VIs) and optimal parameters are also applicable after considering their respective characteristics.
//      the discussion of SG parameters can be found in the following paper:

/*****Update history*****/
//06/2021, add cloud shadows as the invalid value in MODIS data 
//08/2021, 1.update the band name of Landsat 8 SR (B4 -> SR_B4;B5 -> SR_B5;pixel_qa -> QA_PIXEL)
//         and geneneration of Landsat 8 cloud mask
//         2.Users can choose to save a sub area or a period of time series from output data (L348,L366)
//10/2021, updation of generating Landsat 5/7 cloud flag with the new source of Landsat 5/7 surface reflectance on gee 
//12/2021, add the applyScaleFactors function when using USGS Landsat 5/7/8 Level 2, Collection 2 (ref: the guide of these datesets in Earth Engine Data Catalog)
//09/2022, correct some code commenting errors
//04/2024, The GF-SG V3 version (easy-implemented) has been released:    https://code.earthengine.google.com/aa5a7e3d27e9d71889cd5f25e0f6479c?noload=true
           the original GF-SG V1 version can still be referenced via the link: https://code.earthengine.google.com/ffae6b05282fb6e9a83ecbb5019b4958?noload=true
//  !!!!!!!!Features of the new version:
//  1. Unlike the V1 version, which suggests calculating each Landsat tile separately before stitching them together for large area results, the new version supports direct calculation within any large-scale region (as defined by the range of the uploaded shp file) to obtain extensive regional time series data.
//  2. The new version has significantly improved user memory usage and reduced computation time (for example, calculating the NDVI time series data for an area of 11,900 km2 (with an 8-day interval, 46 images) from over 5 hours previously to currently around 40 minutes).
//  3. The new version supports the use of Landsat 5/7/8 data simultaneously for calculations.
//  4. The new version provides SG filtering and Whittaker filtering as options for users to choose based on their needs.
//  5. The new version offers other vegetation index calculations (EVI2, LSWI, NMDI) for reference.
//  6. A simplified linear interpolation and SG filtering program have been provided to improve computational efficiency.
//  7. The new version simplifies the MODIS shape matching process, using unsupervised clustering cross-comparison instead of the neighborhood search matching process.
//  8. The new version has updated dataset usage links, improved some programming errors, reduced program redundancy, and improved some program syntax for easier reading and use.
//  9. Interpolation_v2: https://code.earthengine.google.com/d4760c7869e1d9044ea7d8f5dc3ab138?noload=true
